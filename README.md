# Data Cleaning and Transformation

This repository houses the **Excel files** used for **data cleansing and transformation** pertaining to **Parley and Creme**, a fictional enterprise operating in the paper sales industry. The data manipulation was carried out using **Python**, leveraging the **pandas** library, which proved essential in transforming raw, unstructured data into valuable insights.

## Key Learnings

### üêº **pandas-workshop**
This repository played a pivotal role in establishing the foundational understanding of **pandas**, one of the most powerful libraries for data manipulation in Python. The [pandas-workshop repository](https://github.com/stefmolin/pandas-workshop/blob/main/slides/1-getting_started_with_pandas.ipynb) provided step-by-step guidance on essential functions such as data loading, cleaning, and transforming datasets into a format suitable for analysis. Through this workshop, I gained hands-on experience that significantly boosted my proficiency in using pandas to handle complex datasets.

### üîì **Open Gates**
The metaphor of "Open Gates," inspired by the film *Zootopia*, reflects the moment when data cleaning and transformation are complete, and the data is ready to be unlocked for deeper analysis. Just like a zoo‚Äôs gates opening to reveal its diverse inhabitants, this step signifies that the data is now free of inconsistencies and errors, allowing for insightful exploration and decision-making. This project emphasizes the power of transformed data in unlocking new perspectives and driving informed business decisions.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation Overview

The project primarily focused on addressing common issues found in raw datasets, including:

1. **Missing Data**: Handling missing or incomplete values by using strategies like forward-fill, back-fill, or imputation.
2. **Data Consistency**: Standardizing formats across different columns (e.g., date formatting, currency symbols, and categorical values).
3. **Duplicate Entries**: Identifying and removing duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers in numerical data through statistical techniques.
5. **Data Aggregation**: Aggregating data at different levels to prepare it for reporting, such as summing sales by region or customer.
6. **Data Type Conversion**: Converting columns to appropriate data types (e.g., converting strings to datetime, integers, or floats).
7. **Text Cleaning**: Handling text-based columns by removing extraneous characters or formatting issues (e.g., trimming spaces, standardizing text case).

These transformation steps ensured that the data was clean, accurate, and ready for more complex analysis, including reporting, trend analysis, and predictive modeling.
