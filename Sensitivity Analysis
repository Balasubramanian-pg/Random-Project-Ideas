#Sensitivity Analysis Library (SALib)

Python implementations of commonly used sensitivity analysis methods. Useful in systems modeling to calculate the effects of model inputs or exogenous factors on outputs of interest.

Documentation: ReadTheDocs

Requirements: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, Python 3 (from SALib v1.2 onwards SALib does not officially support Python 2)

Installation: pip install SALib or pip install . or conda install SALib
